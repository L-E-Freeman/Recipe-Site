1. Add a quantity field for ingredients. (DONE)
2. Number the steps of a method (DONE FOR NOW)
3. Add a way to edit a submitted recipe (perhaps GET method). This
may need to include a message saying that recipe was edited successfully. 

. I have an instance of a recipe object which has a specific pk/id attached to it. 
. I should have an edit button on the display_recipe page which is a URL to an edit_recipe page. 
. Edit recipe page needs to have the form data included in the object loaded in when the hyperlink is clicked. 
. User should be able to edit any fields they like in the recipe page and then save again. This should NOT 
create a new recipe object, but changes should be visible in old
recipe object on the index page. (DONE)

----------------------------------------

4. Change duration field to display '40 minutes' instead of 0:40:00. May need to add either custom widget or custom template (DONE)
5. Change the fact that new field boxes are displayed along with delete checkboxes in edit_recipe (CHECKBOXES REMAIN BUT FIELDS GONE.)
6. Write automated tests for current functionality. This may include using WebTest.
7. Make stuff look pretty with css.
8. Add javascript for extra ingredients and methods.
9. Add delete function to existing recipes.
